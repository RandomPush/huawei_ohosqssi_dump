getopt.c

License information for getopt.c. This file is only used on Windows
builds of the executables in the examples folder:

 * This file was copied from the following newsgroup posting:
 *
 * Newsgroups: mod.std.unix
 * Subject: public domain AT&amp;T getopt source
 * Date: 3 Nov 85 19:34:15 GMT
 *
 * Here&prime;s something you&prime;ve all been waiting for:  the AT&amp;T public domain
 * source for getopt(3).  It is the code which was given out at the 1985
 * UNIFORUM conference in Dallas.  I obtained it by electronic mail
 * directly from AT&amp;T.  The people there assure me that it is indeed
 * in the public domain.
